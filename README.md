# Project2 - Catering App

##Summary:
* Catering App was developed to enhance communication and organization within a small team.
* Using a centralized work space, all team members are able to view the most current and up-to-date information. Thus, mitigating miscommunication and promoting cohesiveness within the group.
* Team members are able to create, update, and/or delete any event with the collective approval from the team.
* When a new event is created or updates are made to an existing event, a notification is sent via email to all team members for viewing and approval.
* With intuitive functionality, this application makes shared work flow within a small team easy and efficient.

##Design Layout
[x] Main Page: In this page the approved events and pending events will be displayed with create, update, delete, and view buttons on it.
[x] Create Page: A new event can be created by filling out the form information. The event details will then be sent via email to rest of the team members for approval. Simultaneously, the database will also be populated with the new event record.
[x] View Page: A single event will be displayed with all of it's respective details. There will be delete, update, and approve buttons provided for modifications.
